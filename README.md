This project focuses on the detection of oil refineries using aerial images through a two-stage deep learning pipeline involving segmentation and classification. Initially, we compared two segmentation algorithms, UNet and YOLACT, to isolate relevant regions from high-resolution aerial imagery. Based on evaluation metrics such as F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall, YOLACT outperformed UNet and was selected for the final pipeline. The segmented outputs from YOLACT were then passed into a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier to distinguish between two classes: oil refinery and not oil refinery. The final model (YOLACT + ViT) achieved high accuracy (96.30%) with strong performance, making it suitable for automated and scalable oil refinery detection tasks using remote sensing data.
